# Tiny-Scraping

This was a project for text analysis. 

I first did web-scrapying to extract data from https://stackoverflow.com to get all the questions and answers about R and data-visualization. 

This code is about the data scrapying by connecting to stackexchage API.

However, since the sample size is not satisfactory, the project stopped here temporarily.
